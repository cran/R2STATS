Description: A 'gWidgetsRGtk2' GUI for fitting and comparing GLM or GLMM (based on Douglas Bates' 'lme4' package). It is designed to make comparisons between numerous models easy, both numerically and graphically, which may be useful for teaching. Relevant plots are automatically produced for each model family. 'R2STATS' is *not* a generic graphical interface for R, but a GUI for statistical modelling in a model comparison approach.
